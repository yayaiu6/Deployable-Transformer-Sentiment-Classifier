# Deployable Transformer Sentiment Classifier

## Introduction
Welcome to **Deployable Transformer Sentiment Classifier**, a streamlined sentiment analysis solution powered by a pretrained transformer model. This repository provides a pretrained model and an intuitive **Streamlit web interface**, enabling instant sentiment predictions without complex setup.  
For a step-by-step guide on building a sentiment analysis model from scratch, stay tuned for our upcoming tutorial [link to be added soon].

## Features
- **Plug-and-Play**: Deploy instantly—no training or intricate configuration required.
- **Pretrained Model**: Built on a large sentiment dataset for accurate sentiment classification (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Interactive Streamlit UI**: User-friendly web interface for seamless predictions.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the model or interface for diverse NLP tasks or business needs.
- **Multilingual Support**: Handles English and Arabic (if using a multilingual model).
- **Lightweight & Scalable**: Optimized for quick deployment and extensible for advanced use cases.

## How to Deploy
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/Deployable-Transformer-Sentiment-Classifier.git
   cd Deployable-Transformer-Sentiment-Classifier
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required packages manually:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit>=1.27.0 transformers>=4.30.0
   ```
   For **PyTorch**, choose the appropriate version:
   - **CPU-only** (if no CUDA-compatible GPU):
     ```bash
     pip install torch>=2.0.0
     ```
   - **GPU with CUDA** (if available):
     Visit [PyTorch's official site](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to select the correct command for your CUDA version (e.g., CUDA 11.8, 12.1). Example for CUDA 11.8:
     ```bash
     pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
     ```
   *Note*: To check your CUDA version, run `nvcc --version` or consult your GPU documentation. The app automatically uses CUDA if available.

3. **Verify Model Files**:
   Ensure the following files are in the project directory:
   - `pytorch_model.bin` (pretrained model weights)
   - Tokenizer files (`vocab.txt`, `tokenizer_config.json`, etc.)

4. **Run the App**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Usage**:
   - Open the app in your browser (typically at `http://localhost:8501`).
   - Enter a sentence in the input field.
   - Click **Predict** to view the sentiment result (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

## Customization & Extending
This app is designed for flexibility, making it easy to tailor for specific use cases. To customize:
- **Modify Predictions**: Edit the `predict` function in `sentiment140_utils/inference.py` to support custom output formats or additional languages.
- **Enhance the UI**: Update `app.py` to include features like batch predictions, sentiment visualizations, or user feedback forms.
- **Integrate with APIs**: Connect to social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Instagram) or CRM tools for real-time sentiment analysis.

### Real-World Applications
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Analyze live sentiment from Twitter, Reddit, or other platforms.
- **Customer Feedback Analysis**: Integrate with survey tools or CRMs to assess customer satisfaction.
- **Chatbot Enhancement**: Add sentiment detection to conversational AI for context-aware responses.
- **Business Intelligence**: Create dashboards to track sentiment trends for brands or products.
- **Content Moderation**: Automatically detect negative or toxic comments in forums or reviews.
- **Market Research**: Evaluate sentiment in product reviews, news articles, or focus group data.
